## About the app


###Oh hello there!

Welcome to the web application to manage your personal finances!
You simply need to download the csv template to fill in your expenditure.
Then load it into this application to view them as a dashboard.
You can select the months you would like to compare the data as well as spending types.
I hope you enjoy the app!

Best,
Josh
